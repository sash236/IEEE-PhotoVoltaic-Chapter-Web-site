When Silicon Valley Photovoltaics Society (SVPVS) merged with IEEE in late 2011, 
I designed and developed this web site and maintained it till Jan 2015. The 
slides from the technical talk are not included in this repository. The link 
for the site is: http://www.ewh.ieee.org/r6/scv/pv/index.html

The above site has been updated and moved to a different platform - hence, 
these codes are currently unavailable to view on production.
