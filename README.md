When Silicon Valley Photovoltaics Society (SVPVS) merged with IEEE in late 2011, 
I designed and developed this web site and maintained it till Jan 2015. The 
slides from the technical talk are not included in this repository. 

The site has been updated and moved to a different platform - you can view the site here:
